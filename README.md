# Modeling-Spotify-Skip-Challenge-as-a-Contextual-Bandit-Problem


Hey there!
This is a code repo supporting my project report for DAMI II @SU.

The purpose of this practical study is to evaluate and select the optimal bandit algorithms and heuristics from various member algorithm/learner/method options. Our goal is to recommend new songs by accurately predicting whether the user will skip or continue listening based on their previous listening history. To achieve this, we are utilizing a dataset released by Spotify research, which includes detailed metadata from users' listening history.
